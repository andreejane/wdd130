      <h2>Andree Dayley</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Andree Dayley, I am 21 years old. When I have spare time I like to draw and animate.
        I also enjoy spending time with family, kayaking, going on a drive or evening walk. Someday I hope to pursue computer animation
        as a career; but at the moment I am taking the BYU-I WWD class in hopes to take the next step to being independent
        and get a better job so I can maybe move out of the house. That, and I think programming is fun and exciting.
      </p>
      <p>
        About 20-ish years I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I was born in Vladivostok Russia and adopted very early on.

        I am very excieted to learn about web development over the course of this semester! Errors and all.
